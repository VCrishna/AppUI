      <!-- Introduction to System Design -->
      <p>
        <strong>System design</strong> is a crucial phase in software
        development that involves planning and defining the architecture,
        components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system. It aims to meet
        specific requirements and ensure the scalability, reliability, and
        performance of the system.
      </p>

      <!-- Key Concepts in System Design -->
      <h5>Key Concepts in System Design:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- Scalability -->
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> Designing the system to handle increased
          load and user growth efficiently.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Using load balancing and distributed
          databases to ensure a web application can handle a growing number of
          users.
          <br />
          <strong>Reference:</strong>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability">Scalability</a>
        </li>
        <!-- Reliability -->
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability:</strong> Ensuring the system operates
          consistently and reliably under varying conditions.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Implementing fault-tolerant mechanisms to
          handle server failures in a distributed system.
        </li>
        <!-- Availability -->
        <li>
          <strong>Availability:</strong> Designing for high availability to
          minimize downtime and ensure continuous operation.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Using redundant servers and backup systems
          to maintain service availability.
        </li>
        <!-- Performance -->
        <li>
          <strong>Performance:</strong> Optimizing the system's performance to
          meet response time and throughput requirements.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Caching frequently accessed data to reduce
          latency in a content delivery network.
        </li>
        <!-- Add more key concepts as needed -->
      </ul>

      <!-- System Design Principles -->
      <h5>System Design Principles:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- Modularity -->
        <li>
          <strong>Modularity:</strong> Breaking down the system into independent
          modules for easier development and maintenance.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Dividing an e-commerce system into modules
          for inventory management, user authentication, and order processing.
        </li>
        <!-- Abstraction -->
        <li>
          <strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hiding complex implementation details
          and exposing only relevant functionalities.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Using APIs to interact with a payment
          gateway without needing to understand the internal payment processing
          logic.
          <br />

          >
        </li>
        <!-- Reuse -->
        <li>
          <strong>Reuse:</strong> Reusing existing components and modules to
          save time and resources.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Using a library for image processing instead
          of developing custom image processing functions.
        </li>
        <!-- Scalability Patterns -->
        <li>
          <strong>Scalability Patterns:</strong> Implementing patterns like
          sharding, replication, and load balancing to achieve scalability.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Sharding a database to distribute data
          across multiple servers for improved performance.
          <br />

      <!-- Common System Design Approaches -->
      <h5>Common System Design Approaches:</h5>
      <ul>
        <!-- Monolithic Architecture -->
        <li>
          <strong>Monolithic Architecture:</strong> A single, unified codebase
          for the entire application.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> A traditional content management system
          where all features are part of a single application.
          <br />
          <strong>Reference:</strong>
          <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/monolithic.html"
            >Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture</a
          >
        </li>
        <!-- Microservices Architecture -->
        <li>
          <strong>Microservices Architecture:</strong> Breaking down the
          application into small, independent services.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> An e-commerce platform where separate
          microservices handle user authentication, inventory management, and
          order processing.
        </li>
        <!-- Serverless Architecture -->
        <li>
          <strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> Running applications without
          managing servers.
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Using serverless functions to process data
          uploaded to a cloud storage service without maintaining a dedicated
          server.
        </li>
        <!-- Add more design approaches as needed -->
      </ul>

      <!-- Collaboration and Conclusion -->
      <p>
        System design is a collaborative process involving architects,
        developers, and stakeholders. It requires considering trade-offs and
        making decisions that align with the project's goals.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> Regular meetings between developers and system
        architects to discuss design decisions and trade-offs.
        <br />

      <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
      <p>
        A well-designed system is essential for the success of any software
        project. System design basics provide a foundation for creating robust,
        scalable, and efficient systems that can adapt to changing requirements.
